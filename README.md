1. install nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/ (LTS version is fine)
2. start command line within the folder that contains package.json
3. run the command : npm install
4. run the command : node fetch.js

- you can easily adjust the output object by editing fetch.js file.
- I've edited the response to fit the needs, so full response from server is in full-response-example.json file (to see what extra data is sent)
